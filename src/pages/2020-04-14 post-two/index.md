Being able to utilize the Google Maps API in your React app not only provides a reliable navigation resource for you, but it also improves the overall user experience by incorporating a smooth map interface. Google Map React does a great job giving you access to the Google Maps API and exposing JavaScript functionality and presentation.
Why did I choose to go with google-map-react as opposed to react-google-map? I have no prior experience with the latter and therefore cannot give an accurate assessment, but I was strongly urged against it from fellow classmates who had the ‘misfortune’ to use it. Google Map React, however, received great reviews!
